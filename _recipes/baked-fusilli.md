# Shaun's baked fusilli

## Storytime
So this is really just a baked spaghetti recipe I snagged from the internet and adjusted. So it's mine now.

## Ingredients
* 1 (16 ounce) package fusilli (or whatever noodle you like)
* 1 pound spicy (or not) italian sausage
* 1 white onion, chopped
* 1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 2 eggs
* 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 5 tablespoons butter, melted
* 2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided
* 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir italian sausage and onion until meat is browned and onions are soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.
4. 2 large bowls. With one of them: mix together mozzarella and cottage cheese.
5. With the other: whisk eggs, parmesan cheese, and butter. Mix in noodles to egg mixture and toss to coat. Place half the noodle mixture into baking dish. Top with half the cottage cheese & mozzarella mix. Then, half the meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.
6. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until the cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes longer.
