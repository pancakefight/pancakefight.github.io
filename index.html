  <p>It's 1997. <i>Titanic</i> is in theaters, <i>Foo Fighters</i> are on the radio, and <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> just hit bookshelves. And somewhere in Nebraska, the Garwood family is just sitting down for some pancakes and scrambled eggs for dinner when 10-year-old Kelly decides to tell everyone a joke:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Kelly</b>: Okay, I have a joke.<br>
      <b>Mom</b>: Alright, let's hear it.<br>
      <b>Kelly</b>: What does a gay horse eat?<br>
      <b>Everyone</b>: ...<br>
      <b>Kelly</b>: NO! WAIT! 'say'. Yeah. What does a gay horse say?<br>
      (giggles around the table)<br>
      <b>Kelly</b>: NO! It's "eat"! What does a gay horse eat?<br>
      (uproarious laughter)<br>
      <b>Kelly</b>: I didn't say it yet!
    </p>
  
  <p>(pancakes fly)</p>
  
  <p>So here's some recipes that are ours. They're not always what we intended, but they're pretty great ðŸ™‚ . <br>
  There's lots of chefs, different kitchens, and a melting pot of family names.<br>
  So cook it, invent it, name it, change it, eat it, and throw it.</p>
