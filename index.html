<h1>Pancake Fight</h1>
<p>It's 1997. 'Titanic' is in theaters, 'Foo Fighters' are on the radio, and 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' just hit bookshelves. And somewhere in Nebraska, the Garwood family is just sitting down for some pancakes and scrambled eggs for dinner when 10-year-old Kelly decides to tell everyon a joke:</p>
<p>  Kelly: Okay, I have a joke.<br>
  Mom: Alright, let's hear it.<br>
  Kelly: What does a gay horse eat?<br>
  Everyone: ...<br>
  Kelly: NO! WAIT! 'say'. Yeah. What does a gay horse say?<br>
  (giggles around the table)<br>
  Kelly: NO! It's "eat"! What does a gay horse eat?<br>
  (uproarious laughter)<br>
  Kelly: I didn't say it yet!</p>

<p>(pancakes fly)</p>

<p>So here's some recipes that are ours. They're not always what we intended, but they're pretty great :-)<br>
There's lots of chefs, different kitchens, and a melting pot of family names.<br>
So cook it, invent it, name it, change it, eat it, and throw it.</p>
