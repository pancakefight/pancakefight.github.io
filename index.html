<h1>Pancake Fight</h1>
<p>It's 1997. <i>Titanic</i> is in theaters, <i>Foo Fighters</i> are on the radio, and <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> just hit bookshelves. And somewhere in Nebraska, the Garwood family is just sitting down for some pancakes and scrambled eggs for dinner when 10-year-old Kelly decides to tell everyon a joke:</p>
<div class='a'>
  <p>
    Kelly: Okay, I have a joke.<br>
    Mom: Alright, let's hear it.<br>
    Kelly: What does a gay horse eat?<br>
    Everyone: ...<br>
    Kelly: NO! WAIT! 'say'. Yeah. What does a gay horse say?<br>
    (giggles around the table)<br>
    Kelly: NO! It's "eat"! What does a gay horse eat?<br>
    (uproarious laughter)<br>
    Kelly: I didn't say it yet!
  </p>
</div>

<p>(pancakes fly)</p>

<p>So here's some recipes that are ours. They're not always what we intended, but they're pretty great :-)<br>
There's lots of chefs, different kitchens, and a melting pot of family names.<br>
So cook it, invent it, name it, change it, eat it, and throw it.</p>
