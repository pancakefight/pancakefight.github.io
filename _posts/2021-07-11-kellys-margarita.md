# Kelly's Margarita

## Storytime
(true story) Carlos “Danny” Herrera, owner of Tijuana restaurant Rancho La Gloria, claims he invented the drink in 1938. What inspired him? A picky dancer, it seems. Restaurant goer Marjorie King declared she was allergic to all spirits except tequila, but didn’t like to drink the spirit straight. So Herrera worked around the prototypical tequila shot (which is taken with salt and lime) and threw together the margarita. While all bartenders can relate to the situation of an annoying customer, it was Herrera who claims to have whipped up the instant classic – or so says his obituary. By the way, he lived until 90, once again proving that alcohol is probably really good for you.

In 2020, Kelly and Aaron Warehime perfected Caros Herrara's recipe to make a perfect blend of tasty and easy.

Also, Costco has really good deals on Agave Syrup.
