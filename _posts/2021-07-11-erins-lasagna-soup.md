# Erin's Lasagna Soup

## Storytime
The year is 1886 and in Atlanta, Georgia, a poor bookkeeper named Fran Granderson had just finished a hard day's work for Larson's Drugstore. She needed a hearty meal to feed her family of 5. Having Italian heritage but also being the daughter of an English farmer, she dreamed of a meal that would both honor her heritage but keep someone full while working in the fields. A recipe that would be handed down through generations as the "soup that sticks to your ribs". After several iterations, she came up with a concoction that combined Italian sausage, onion, a hearty sauce, and lasagna noodles.

135 years later, Erin Garwood just so happened to recreate the same recipe, but she added Parmesan cheese.

This is the story of Erin's recipe...

## Ingredients
* 1/2 or 1pound spicy Italian sausage (based on how much you prefer)
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 (24 oz.) jar Prego Traditional Italian Sauce
* 8-10 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided
* 1 (14 oz.) can crushed tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoon dried basil
* 1 teaspoon dried parsley
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 whole bay leaf
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 10 uncooked lasagna noodles, broken into approx. 1-2 inch pieces
* 1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)

### Garnish
finely grated Parmesan cheese

## Directions
1. Heat large pot over medium high heat. Add sausage and onion and cook, stirring occasionally until sausage is browned. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and saute for 30 seconds. Drain off any excess fat.
2. Add Prego Sauce, 6 cups chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, sugar, spices and lasagna noodles. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer until lasagna noodles are tender, stirring occasionally (approximately 20-30 minutes).
3. Discard bay leaf and stir in heavy cream (optional) and 2-4 cups chicken broth to reach desired consistency. Garnish individual servings with desired amount of cheeses.
