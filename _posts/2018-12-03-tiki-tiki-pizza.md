# Tiki Tiki Pizza

## Storytime
Shaun: Amanda used to get this pizza at a little place where she grew up. We recreated it and make it pretty much every Monday for "makin' Monday" (kids have to cook or at least help cook).

## Ingredients
* 1 store bought pizza dough, we use "Wewalka: Round & Thin Crust"
* 1/2 chicken breast
* 1 small can of pineapple chunks
* 1 small jar of artichoke hearts
* Feta cheese crumbles
* Minced garlic
* Shredded mozerlla cheese, we get the "Shreddable mozzerella"
* Basil Pesto, we get "Classico: Sauce & Spread"

## Directions
1. Cook up chicken, then add honey-dijon dressing. Personally, I chop up chicken into milk-dud sized pieces and cook in some vegetable oil on the stove.
2. Preheat oven per the directions on the crust packaging.
3. Put a couple pieces of pineapple and artichoke on paper towels to sop up some of the juices before they go on the pizza.
4. Unroll pizza crust, add the basil pesto. The sauce we get can be a little too oily sometimes so I have to put it on a paper towel to soak up some oil.
5. Add cheese, add the toppings as you see fit.
6. Cook per the instructions on the pizza dough packaging.
