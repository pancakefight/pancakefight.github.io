# Shaun's Brussel Sprouts

## Serves
This'll serve about 4-5 people as a side dish.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound brussel sprouts (before trimming)
- Olive oil
- ½ package of bacon
- ⅓ cup of sriracha
- ⅓ cup of lime juice
- 1 cup of honey

## Instructions
1. Cook up the bacon til fairly crispy. Cut or crumble into chocolate chip sized pieces.
2. Cut the stems off the brussel sprouts. Then cut the rest of the brussel sprout into thirds, long ways. ![brussel-sprout.jpg](assets/brussel-sprout.jpg)
3. Fry them up in a pan on the stove with enough olive oil to lightly drizzle each piece. Fry until they get to the desired level of crispy. I usually get them fairly black.
4. In a seperate bowl, combine sriracha, lime juice, and honey. Adjust sriracha for varied spiciness. As-is it's a pretty good level for everyone but you can taste the spiceness.
5. Add the bacon to the brussel sprouts. Serve with sauce as a topper.
