# Mama Dub's Caramel Popcorn Balls

## Storytime
Aaron: "A staple of my childhood and one I like to make during the holidays or whenever I can find an excuse.  Be sure to recruit some helpers because the final portion needs to be done quickly.  More hands make less work ðŸ˜Š"


## Ingredients
- Â½ cup unsalted butter
- 2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- 1 15-oz can sweetened condensed milk  (I think they are now sold in 14.5-oz cans, or something dumb like that, but its all the same)
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 10 quarts of popped corn\*

## Directions
1. In a saucepan, combine butter, sugar, and corn syrup.  Stir well and bring to boiling over medium heat
2. Stir in condensed milk.  Simmer, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to firm ball stage. Turn off heat and stir in vanilla.
3. Get a small dish and fill with several ice cubes
4. Spread out popped corn on large table (preferably on a non-stick surface such as parchment paper, but a clean counter will work as well) and poor caramel over popped corn stirring to coat. 
5. Rub an ice cube between your hands, coating your palms and fingers in cool water, and shape mixture into balls about 3-4 inches in diameter.  Continue to rub ice cubes on palms of your hands to prevent burns and help prevent mixture from sticking to your hands
6. Makes around 30\*\*

## Notes
\*be sure to use unsalted/unbuttered/unflavored popcorn.  It is usually best (and cheapest) to use stove top popcorn

\*\* Storage:  wrap each ball in plastic wrap or a sandwich baggie. Donâ€™t worry about them going bad as you will eat them before that happens.


## TIPS
- Stir. Stir. STIR.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STIR.  Like constantly. No one likes burned caramel.  And donâ€™t get impatient and turn up the heat.  A nice medium to medium low heat is what is needed here.
- I have had very limited success on using a candy thermometer to measure when the caramel has reached soft ball phase.  This is the trickiest part and one that can cause it all to fall apart.  I instead use a class of cold water with ice cubes.  Drip a small amount of caramel into the water. It is at firm ball stage when it forms a ball that holds its shape until pressed.  I do recommend erring on the side of too much, rather than too little time. That said, you do not want to get to hard ball stage.
- I cannot express enough how important the ice cubes are when forming the popcorn balls.  Use them constantly, usually in the beginning after each ball or so, to prevent burns (that caramel is HOT!) and to keep the caramel from sticking to your hands.
- After mixing the caramel and the popcorn, if you find that it is not holding a ball shape, wait a minute or two.  It may just need to cool a bit before it will take shape.
