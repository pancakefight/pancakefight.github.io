# Best Damn Biscuits and Gravy

## Storytime
Aaron: "Kelly and I were on a B&G kick after having some amazing ones at a restaurant in Denver. This recipe uses some unusual ingredients and some improvisation that has developed into one of our all-time favorites. You can use either breakfast sausage or hot Italian sausage. Both are delicious and give different flavors to the dish. Don’t forget the sage it helps balance and bring everything together!"


## Ingredients
* 1 can of Pillbury biscuits (8 count)
* 1 lb Sausage (breakfast or hot Italian)
* 1 medium to large onion (diced)
* 1 – 15oz jar of four cheese alfredo sauce (we use Classico)
* Milk
* Flour
* Sage
* Green onion (if your feeling fancy, if not don’t worry about it)

## Directions
1. Preheat oven and bake biscuits as directed. Make sure those bad boys are nice and crispy
2. While biscuits bake, get out a LARGE saucepan (I use our walled skillet for this)
3. Get the sausage and onion going until sausage is browned and onion is softened.
4. Drain (if you want. I don’t because I like that FLAVOR!!)
5. Add Alfredo sauce to the pan. Pour milk into the now empty alfredo jar to 1/3 full. Recap,
shake and pour into pan.
6. Add sage. This part is a bit tricky as it is really to taste. I would say at least 2 tsp. worth
7. Once everything has heated up, add flour. I would say around 1 tbsp, but you may need more
to thicken.
8. Once everything is nice and bubbly serve on biscuits. Sprinkle with green onion if you fancy.
