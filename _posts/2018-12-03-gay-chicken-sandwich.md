# Gay Chicken Sandwich

## Storytime
Trying to re-create chick-fila's spicy chicken sandwich. Getting pretty close (1/20/2019).

## Brine
Make a brine of ¼ cup Kosher salt (the big grains) and ¼ sugar with 4 cups water (not listed in ingredients). Put the pounded chicken in the brine and refrigerate for 6 hours to overnight. While this is not 100% necessary, it makes the chicken much juicier and consistent (no weird chewy bits).

## Ingredients
- 1 cup of vegetable oil (peanut oil is better if you can find it)
- ⅓ cup Frank's original red hot pepper sauce (or HOT Frank's if you want spicier)
- ⅔ cup water
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons salt
- 4 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon fresh coarse ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- 4 chicken breast fillets
- 4 hamburger buns
- mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, whatever you wanna top them with


## Directions
1. Use a small shallow pot just large enough to cook 1 chicken breast at a time. Fill it with enough oil to cover half of each flatten chicken breast you put in there. So like 1/4 of an inch. Heat medium-high (5 on a 1-10).
2. Combine the pepper sauce and water in a small bowl.
3. Combine the flour, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, onion powder, paprika and garlic powder in another shallow bowl.
4. Pound each of the chicken pieces with a mallet until about 3/8-inch thick. Trim each breast fillet if necessary to help it fit on the bun.
5. Working with one fillet at a time, coat each piece with the flour, then dredge it in the diluted pepper sauce. Coat the chicken once again in the flour mixture and set it aside until the rest of the chicken is coated.
6. Fry the chicken in the pot, half should be above the oil. 2-3 minutes each side. Set on a wire mesh or paper towel. Chicken will be too hot for like 5 minutes.
7. Put chicken on the buns, hun! Top with what you want.

## Try next time
Note to self:
- Whisk 1 cup milk and 2 eggs. Drizzle 3 tablespoons of it into the spice/flour mixture to make a bunch of beads. Will create more crispy nuggets.
