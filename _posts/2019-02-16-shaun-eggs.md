# Shaun's Perfect Hardboiled Egg

## Ingredients
- eggs

## Instructions
1. Put your eggs in a pot. Put just enough cold water in so they're submerged. Put the pot on the stove, heat to boil.
2. Just as they begin boiling, start your timer for 9 minutes. While they're cooking, prepare a bowl with ice water to submerge them in once they're done.
3. Once the timer is up, remove from stove and scoop each egg out and gently put into the ice water. This is to stop them from continuing to cook. Let them chill for at least 10 minutes.

Enjoy! Rule of thumb is that they'll keep for 2 weeks. I like to write the expiration date on the shell with a sharpie. Also I give each one a funny face for when Amanda peels it.

Also, the perfect 9 minutes was perfected at 5,280 feet elevation. You may have to adjust, but probably not much.
