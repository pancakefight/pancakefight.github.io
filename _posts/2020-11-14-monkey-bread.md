# Monkey Bread

## Storytime
Otherwise known as "monkey feet" or "monkey brains", this was a staple in the Garwood house, especially on Christmas. Also, Kelly totally made this with 1 full cup of cinnamon once.

## Ingredients
* 2 4-packs of biscuits
* 1 cup sugar (seperated)
* 1 Tbsp cinnamon (seperate)
* 3/4 cup margarine

## Directions
1. Create a "dry mix": 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon.
2. Over medium heat, create a "wet mix": 3/4 cup margarine, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon.
3. Cut up each raw biscuit into 4 pieces. Roll each piece in the dry mix before placing in 9x13 pan.
4. Pour wet mix over all the pieces in the pan.
5. Cook 25-35 minutes at 350 degrees, until crispy golden outside.
