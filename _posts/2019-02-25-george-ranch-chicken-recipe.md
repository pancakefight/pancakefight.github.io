# George's Ranch Chicken Dip

## Storytime
You may think it's George's "Ranch Chicken Dip", but it's actually George's Ranch "Chicken Dip". George owns a modest 5 acre ranch in west Texas where he and his dog, Zipper, spend their summers perfecting George's Ranch "Chicken Dip". From farm to table, he and Zipper hope you and yours enjoy eating it just as much as they enjoy making it.

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs cooked chicken (we just used the bags of pre cooked fajita chicken, diced into small cubes)
- 1 lb cubed cheese (we used Colby Jack)
- 1 block cream cheese
- 1/4 stick of butter (you can go with more or less depending on you preference)
- 1 packet of dry ranch dressing mix
- 1 bottle of Frank's buffalo sauce (make sure it's regular buffalo, not the extra hot, that'd be ridiculously spicy lol)
- Shredded cheese on top (we just used shredded Queso cheese, though there's this Taco Bell brand zesty ranch cheese I've been dying to try in this)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)

## Instructions
1. Basically throw it all in the croc pot, we layered it. We added a base of cubed cheese, then some chicken on top of that, then some buffalo sauce. Repeat that process until it's full; spices, ranch mix and extra shredded cheese on top, cook on low for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally or until the cheese melts. If using fresh chicken, just be sure to cook it and dice it up before throwing it into the croc pot!
