# The Evolution of the Kaffee Kuchen+

## Storytime
Aaron: "This is the recipe my mother used to make but tweaked so the cake is fluffier and has a brighter flavor.  Itâ€™s taken a while in perfecting, but I know you will enjoy. It usually takes a hungover me about 1.5 hrs from start to finish to make this.  So, an hour under normal circumstances."


## Ingredients
- Â½ cup butter, softened   
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 egg separated\* 
- 1Â½ cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- Â½ tsp salt
- Â½ cup milk

## Directions
1. Pre-heat oven to 350Â° and grease 9x9x2-inch round cake pan.  I also like to put parchment paper at the bottom of the pan to help keep it from sticking.
2.Cream butter and sugar.  I mean really just beat the hell out of it.  Once done, beat in egg yolks with the same enthusiasm.  
3. In a separate bowl, sift together dry ingredients.  If you donâ€™t have a sifter, just put ingredients into a large bowl and stir with a wire whisk
4. Add dry ingredients into butter/sugar mixture alternately with milk, beating after each addition (I usually just keep my KitchenAid on the stir setting and add dry ingredients Â¼ of a cup at a time adding milk after each addition)
5. Beat egg whites until stiff\*\*
6. Fold in egg whites\*\*\*
7. Pour mixture into greased cake pan
8. Make topping (see below) and sprinkle evenly across the top of the mixture.
9. Put into the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
10. Enjoy!

## Topping
- Â¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 Tbsp melted butter
- Â½ cup of chopped nuts (I usually use walnuts or pecans)

Mix all dry ingredients together in a small bowl.  Add melted butter and stir.

## Notes
\* separate them yolks from them whites.  Donâ€™t worry they will be getting back together ðŸ˜Š

\*\*Okay this is pretty crucial.  As with the butter and sugar, just beat the hell out of those egg whites.  DONâ€™T UNDERBEAT!

\*\*\*Now that those egg whites are all stiff and peaky, you got to be gentle getting them in.  Fold them in nice and easy with a spatula by hand.  Wrap those egg whites up in the dough and fold until just mixed. Do NOT use your KitchenAid or youâ€™ll push all the fluff out.


## TIPS
Be sure to be measuring your flour and sugar correctly (brown sugar is the exception. You gotta pack that shit!).  Spoon the ingredients lightly into the measuring cup and then level it off with the straight edge of a spatula or knife.
Make sure that your butter is properly softened.  Otherwise you are going to have a devil of a time creaming it with the sugar.  You really want it softened but not melted. (ugh I know, right?!)  This usually takes butter from the fridge about 30-45 min. or you can soften in the microwave.  Perfectly softened butter should give gently to pressure but shouldnâ€™t be soft in appearance.
