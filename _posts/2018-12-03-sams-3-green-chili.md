# Sam's No 3 Kickin' Green Chili

## Storytime
Original recipe: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sams-no3-kickin-green-chili-recipe-1923947
We took out some tomatoes. There were a lot of tomatoes.

## Ingredients
* Five 4 1/2-ounce cans green chiles
* 3 sticks (12 ounces) butter or margarine, plus more for sauteing pork
* 3 pounds pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 2 large white onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 3/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
* 1 3/4 tablespoons ground dry mustard powder
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 2 teaspoons granulated garlic
* 3 large tomatoes, cut into as small as Amanda can handle
* Two 14 1/2-ounce cans diced tomatoes
* 3 fresh jalapenos, diced, optional for added heat
* 1 cup flour

## Directions
1. Mix all the spices in a bowl beforehand. Makes things easier.
2. Heat some butter in a large pot and add the cubed pork. Cook about 15 minutes, and then add the onions and spices. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally. When the pork has cooked through, add the fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes, green chiles and jalapenos, if using. Stir occasionally.
3. After 5 minutes, add 8 cups water. Bring to a low boil. Stir occasionally. Increase the heat and bring the chili to a rolling or high boil.
4. In separate pan, melt the butter or margarine and whisk in the flour, stirring until creamy. This is called "roux".
5. Slowly add the roux to the chili, stirring constantly, and shut off the heat. Continue to stir so that the roux is evenly distributed. (Roux amount can be adjusted depending on desired consistency or thickness.)
6. Let stand 5 minutes and serve in a bowl or smothered! **WARNING: it'll be very hot for quite a while.**
