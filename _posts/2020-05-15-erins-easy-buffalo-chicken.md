# Erin's Easy Buffalo Chicken

## Storytime
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

^ this is a grammatically correct sentence. "Buffalo" is singular and plural for the animal, it is a place, but it is also a verb meaning "to bully". Broken down, it reads as: *Bison from Buffalo, New York who are intimidated by other bison in their community also happen to intimidate other bison in their community*.

How wild is that? Anyway, here's an easy buffalo chicken recipe...

## Ingredients
* 2-3 Chicken breast
* Frank's wing sauce 
* Packet of hidden valley ranch seasoning 
* 3 tbl. Butter

## Directions
1. Crockpot the chicken, seasoning, and sauce (enough to cover the chicken well) for 3 to 4 hours or until chicken is cooked. 
2. Remove chicken and shred. Add a few tablespoons of butter to crockpot and add chicken back in. Keep warm until butter melts. 

Serve on toasted bread. Could serve with jalepenos, pickles, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, or cheese.
