# Chili's Salsa
## Storytime
So for Amanda's birthday, the kids and us went to Chili's LARGELY for the salsa. Then we had horrible service, a bad chicken sandwich, and the idea: hey, we could probably make this salsa at home. So we googled it, found it, here's a copy/paste:

## Ingredients
- 1 (14 1/2 ounce) can tomatoes and green chilies
- 1 (14 1/2 ounce) can whole canned tomatoes (plus the juice)
- 4 teaspoons jalapenos (canned,diced, not pickled)
- 1⁄4 cup yellow onion (diced)
- 1⁄2-3⁄4 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1⁄2 teaspoon cumin
- 1⁄4 teaspoon sugar

## Instructions
1. In food processor place jalapenos and onions. Process for just a few seconds.
1. Add both cans of tomatoes, salt, sugar, and cumin.
1. Process all ingredients until well blended but do not puree.
1. Place in covered container and chill. A couple of hours of chilling will help blend and enrich the flavor.
