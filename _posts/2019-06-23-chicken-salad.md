# Shamanda's Chicken Salad

## Storytime
So this one weekend, Amanda and I REALLY wanted a chicken salad and we were just obsessing about it and we were like, 'Man, we are gonna make some of that.' So Saturday, we went out and got, like, a pound of chikcen and then we boiled them all and we just, we spent, I dunno, probably three hours, like three and a half hours making, you know, the mayonnaise, and the celery and, you know, the necessary accoutrement. And then, by the time we were done, we didn't really feel like like eating it.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound cooked chicken breast chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/2 cup celery chopped finely (optional)
- 1/2 cup of corn (optional)


## Instructions
1. Cook all your chicken. We boil it in chicken broth, some good flavor there. You do you. Then shred it up.
2. Put it all together in bowl.
3. Put in the fridge for at least an hour.
