# Erin's Greek Veggie Wraps

## Storytime
For the last 78 years, a research group has been monitoring the output of 50 monkies typing on 50 computers in the hopes that they will produce Shakespear at some point. While they found several interesting conclusions, they have yet to see anything that resembles the work of William. However, they did find, try, and enjoy this recipe for veggie wraps. Much to their surprise, it was tasty and healthy. Though the monkey's kept mispelling "tzataiki".

## Ingredients
* Pita pockets or big tortilla (if you want to do a wrap or pockets)
* 1 can of chickpeas/garbanzo beans (they are the same thing!, who knew?)
* 1 container of grape tomatoes
* 1/5 red onion
* 1 cucumber
* 1 container of crumbled feta cheese
* Spicy hummus
* Tzatziki sauce

## Directions
1. drain and rinse can of chickpeas
2. dice cucumber, tomatoes, and red onion
3. in large bowl combine chickpeas, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions.
4. spread hummus and tzatziki inside pita or tortilla
5. add mixture and top with feta
6. roll up and feast!
