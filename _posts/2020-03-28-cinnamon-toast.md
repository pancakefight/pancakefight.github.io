# Cinnamon Toast "the Right Way"

## Storytime
Found this recipe online, made it for Amanda and the kids. Turned out great. However the recipe started with 3 ways "not" to make cinnamon toast. Complete with 30+ high res pictures. It was awful. This is a much more boiled down version.

This will make a good 9-10 pieces.

## Ingredients
* 1 stick of butter
* 1/2 cup of sugar
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Smush softened butter with a fork. Dump in sugar, cinnamon, vanilla. Stir/smoosh/scrape to completely combine.
3. Spread on slices of bread, completely covering the surface all the way to the edges.
4. Place bread on a cookie sheet. Place cookies sheet into the oven and bake for 10 minutes.
5. Turn on the broiler and broil until golden brown and bubbling (1-2 minutes). Watch so it won't burn!
6. Boom!
