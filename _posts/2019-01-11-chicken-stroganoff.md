# Shaun's Chicken Stroganoff

## Ingredients
- 16ish oz package of noodles (we use rotini)
- ½ white onion, chopped
- 1 pound chicken breasts, cut into chunks
- 1 can cut green beans
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon (smoked?) paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground pepper
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions
1. Cook noodles like you cook you noodles. Salt if you want.
2. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Add the onion and cook until slightly soft, about 2 minutes.
4. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the chicken, flour, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until the chicken browns, about 3 minutes.
5. Add the chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a gentle simmer; cook until thickened, another 2-3 minutes.
6. Stir in the sour cream and green beans. Continue simmering gently until the chicken is cooked through.
7. Add noodles to mix and serve!
