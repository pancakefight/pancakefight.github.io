# Mexican Mix-Up

## Storytime
Shaun: Every sane person I know puts the cheese on top the mix-up, so that it'll melt. Roger Garwood puts the fritos on first.

## Feeds
Will feed about 2 hungry adults.

## Ingredients
* 1 pound of hamburger
* 1 can of pork & beans
* 3/4 cup of ketchup (switch this with Heinz chili sauce for a little more kick)
* All the taco fixings you want:
⋅⋅⋅frito corn chips (highly recommended)
⋅⋅⋅shredded cheese
⋅⋅⋅lettuce
⋅⋅⋅tomatoes
⋅⋅⋅onions
⋅⋅⋅salsa

## Directions
1. Brown the hamburger in a pan.
2. Add can of pork&beans and ketchup.
3. Serve! On a plate, put 1 healthy servering spoon of mix-up laid flat, then cheese, crushed up corn chips, then your choice of taco fixings.
