## Ingredients
* 4 hamburger buns, split
* 1 head green leaf lettuce, leaves separated
* 1 beefsteak tomato, sliced
* 20 dill pickle slices
FOR THE CHICKEN
* 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 1 cup dill pickle juice
* 1 1/2 cups milk, divided
* 1 cup peanut oil
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Directions
1. Place a chicken breast on a cutting board. With your hand flat on top of it, carefully slice the chicken in half horizontally. Trim excess fat as needed.
2. In a large shallow baking dish, combine chicken, pickle juice and 1/2 cup milk; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Drain well.
3. Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
4. In another large shallow baking dish, whisk together remaining 1 cup milk and egg. Stir in chicken to coat and drain excess milk mixture.
5. In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken, flour and confectioners’ sugar; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
6. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
7. Serve chicken immediately on burger buns with green leaf lettuce, tomato and pickles.
